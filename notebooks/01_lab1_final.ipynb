        "In this tutorial we will be using fingerprints for the representation of the molecular structures. There are many variants, but the use of Morgan fingerprints is quite commom. The will be covering the theoretical basis of fingerprints in the lectures. Fingerprints can be of two types, binary and count. The binary fingerprint bits are set to 1 if the corresponding structural moiety is present and 0 if absent, regardless of the number of occurrences in the molecular structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Count fingerprints also include the number of occurrences in the molecular structure, without accounting for their relative position. For both binary and count fingerprints we can set the radius and the lengh. The radius reflects the size of he structural moieties assigned to the bits, whilst the length gives the number of bits. There is a tradeoff. If the length is too small bit collisions will be more frequent and detrimental. On the other hand, if the length is too large, the model fitting will take longer and the input vector for each molecule is larger. In addition, most bits will be inactive and it may be harder to train the model even if there is sufficient computing capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use binary Morgan fingerprints of radius 2 and of length 1024. In a real life application some more exploration would be needed to optimise the fingerprint parameters, perhaps as part of the hyper parameter tuning that will cover in the second lab.\n",

In order to keep things simple, we will simply run a small predefined number of epochs without such early stopping mechanism."

On the other hand, if we withhold a significant part of the data for evaluation of the predictive performance we may get a pessimistically biased estimate. This is because the model would have improved if trained with more data assuming that it has not reached its capacity. On the other hand, keeping too few datapoints for evaluating the predictive performance could increase its variance. This interplay between variance and bias is a common theme in this area of work. You may hear the expressions \"there is no free lunch\" and \"find the sweet spot\" quite often. In practice, there are also better ways to split the available data, .e.g. based on k-fold cross validation, as discussed in the lecture."
