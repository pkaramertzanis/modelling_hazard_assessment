## Theory 1: Principles of Machine Learning

**(100 min)**

- **Principles of Machine Learning**  
  Machine learning involves creating algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions. 
  In toxicology, machine learning can be used to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds by analyzing patterns 
  in biological data. For example, models can be trained to identify potential carcinogens based on historical data.

- **What is AI, and which flavours? History of AI**  
  AI encompasses various technologies, including machine learning, that simulate human intelligence. 
  In chemical hazard assessment, AI can automate the analysis of large datasets to identify hazardous chemicals. 
  The history of AI in this field includes the development of expert systems that assist in regulatory 
  compliance and risk assessment.

- **Architecture - algorithm? Regression based vs neural network**  
  Regression models, such as logistic regression, are used to predict binary outcomes like 
  the presence or absence of a toxic effect. Neural networks, on the other hand, can model complex relationships 
  in data, such as predicting the interaction effects of multiple chemicals on human health.

- **What is a neural network, building blocks**  
  Neural networks consist of interconnected neurons that process data in layers. In toxicology, neural 
  networks can be used to model dose-response relationships, where the input layer represents chemical 
  concentrations and the output layer predicts biological responses.

- **Embedding; from data to numbers, examples, tensors, vectors**  
  Embedding techniques convert categorical data, such as chemical names, into numerical vectors that 
  can be processed by machine learning models. In chemical hazard assessment, embeddings can represent 
  molecular structures, allowing models to learn from structural similarities between compounds.

- **Features, feature space (materials from AIRA course)**  
  Features in machine learning are the input variables used to make predictions. In toxicology, features 
  might include molecular weight, solubility, and other physicochemical properties. The feature space is the 
  multidimensional space where these features are represented, and effective feature selection is crucial for 
  accurate predictions.

- **Validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out, metrics of performance**  
  Validation techniques ensure the reliability of machine learning models. In chemical hazard assessment, 
  cross-validation can be used to evaluate models that predict the environmental impact of chemicals. Performance 
  metrics such as sensitivity and specificity are important for assessing model accuracy in identifying hazardous 
  substances.

- **Which models are used?**  
  Various models are used in machine learning, including decision trees, which can classify chemicals based 
  on their hazard potential, and support vector machines, which can separate toxic from non-toxic compounds. 
  Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, are increasingly used for image-based toxicity 
  screening.
